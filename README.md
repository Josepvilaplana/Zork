## Strugglings
The main problem has been the lack of time and that I had not programmed in C++ for 4 years, given that when I finished my degree I focused on Production and Program Management.

Enrolling in this master's degree was a decision I made at the last minute. If I had known this in advance, I would have spent a few weeks recovering my old knowledge of C++ and would have managed the exam times better, given that it coincided completely with a long trip outside of Europe that made it very difficult for me to find time and a place to work and move forward with the exam.

In any case, I am aware that I am far from the expected level to enter this master and that I have not met the minimum objectives to pass it. If I am denied, I have no doubt that I will start studying C++ seriously to be able to register again for the next edition of the master.

In any case, the time I have dedicated to it has served to confirm that I love programming, that I want to master C++ and that this is the path I am going to follow.
